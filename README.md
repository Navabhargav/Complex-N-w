The small world phenomenon can explain the occurrence of various social processes, and this can be analysed through contact channels of individuals acting as nodes and their networks as links, this was initiated by Pool and Kochen in 1970â€™s. They worked on anecdotal experience of two strangers, meeting and finding out to share a common acquaintance work a small-world phenomenon (Schnettler,2009). 
This idea was further empirically developed by Stanley Milgram for tracing the connection between people.

Stanley Milgram's experiment on the small world phenomenon remains a cornerstone in understanding social networks and human connectivity. 
His study revealed the surprisingly short average path length between individuals, popularly known as "six degrees of separation." 
This paper aims to analyze the small world effect within the context of network science, focusing on three network models: Random Poisson, Barabasi-Albert scale-free and Watts-Strogatz small world networks. Most briefly on the random Poisson and scale-free.
